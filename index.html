      <h2 style="text-align: center;">About Me!</h2>
      <!-- my background -->
      <p> My interest in programming began back in elementary school, when I would sometimes stay in for recess so I
        could play with a teaching language called <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a>.</p>
      <p> Despite my job as a lead software engineer, I actually went to school to study English! At the time I wanted
        to be an English professor. When I realized it wasn't what I wanted, I was able to use my self-taught knowledge
        to acquire a job programming.</p>
      <!-- state that I enjoy working with people -->
      <p> Since then, I've gained a lot of experience programming and working with a great team of developers, testers,
        and designers! I've also taken a boot camp program from <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> to fill
        in some of the knowledge I'd have otherwise picked up in college.</p>
      <!-- info about my hobbies --> 
      <p> Besides my job, I have lots of hobbies--I write, play guitar and bass, draw, have a black belt in karate and a
        brown belt in judo.</p>
