      <h3>About Me!</h3>
      <p> My interest in programming began back in elementary school, when I would sometimes stay in for recess so I could play with a teaching language called Logo.</p>
      <p> Despite my job as a lead software engineer, I actually went to school to study English! At the time I wanted to be an English professor. When I realized it wasn't what I wanted, I was able to use my self-taught knowledge to acquire a job programming.</p>
      <p> Since then, I've gained a lot of experience programming, and taken a boot camp program at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> to fill in some of the knowledge I'd have otherwise picked up in college.</p>
      <p> Besides my job, I have lots of hobbies--I write, play guitar and bass, draw, and have a black belt in karate and a brown belt in judo.</p>
